                        In this milestone we have made huge infrastructure progress in the game.
                        We now have the whole network working where we can synchronize the player
                        data (head, hands position and orientation) as well as the ball position.
                        Now we have two client side and one server side working, and we have also
                        integrated physics engine into our server calculating the collision and
                        reflection.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By the end of June 10th Sunday, we are able to make this a playable game
                        among two players. The next steps are to add lots of special graphics to
                        the system and refine all the models, make slight fixes to the physics
                        simulateion, add more game logics to improve game experience, and add more
                        audios. Since the infrastructure is already settled up so we are expecting
                        all these to be done tomorrow.
