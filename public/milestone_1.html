                        The picture above is the concept art of our game. We are going to make a
                        ping pong game that is settled up in a futuristic environment. There are
                        going to be two users competiting on their ping pong skills. But in addition
                        to holding rackets to hit the ball, the user is also going to hold a special
                        ability controller, and on that controller they are going to be able to use
                        three different skills: bullet time, hide the ball as well as trigger a
                        reverse-xy in the velocity of the ball. The whole scene will be set up in
                        a tunnel scene and the ball can bounce when it hits the wall, floor and
                        ceiling. Once the player failed to hit the ball, the player lose the round
                        and another round will be started. There will also be a score counter for
                        the two users.

                        Currently we are working on the network communication aspect of the game and
                        we haven't touched any graphics yet. But we did made some models of the
                        tunnel and rackets using blender. The picture is shown in the bottom.
