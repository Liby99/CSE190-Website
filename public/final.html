                <h2>Neon Ping Pong: Overview</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        In this Neon Ping Pong Project, we implemented various aspect of ping pong playing.
                        We have the basic physics: the ping pong ball can bounce around the walls, being hit
                        by the racket which is following the players' movement.
                        We have self designed game interface, user interactions and environment. All of the 
                        models we are using are modelled by ourselves. We've also created various shaders
                        to make the room more perceivable: We gave distinct color to each player, another
                        distinct color for the ball and a indicator for its movements. We have letters 
                        floating around the scene so that the players can know the current status and scores.
                        We have a fully enabled p2p rpc server which can sync up the state between two 
                        computers. All of the physics calculation is on the RPC server.
                        To improve the gaming experience, we've also enabled the Bullet Time special ability
                        for the user. With this ability, the player can trigger their own bullet time to 
                        increase the chance hitting the ball.
                        We have a very emersive sound system. We have self-composed sound effects for ball
                        bouncing, hitting, scoring, time counting. We also composed a background music. In
                        addition, when the bullet time effect is triggered, we will decrease the pitch of 
                        the music to give a better sense for the player that the time has been slow down.
